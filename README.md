# QuickRent Project

## Introduction
The "QuickRent" project is a web application system that serves as an online platform for renting various items at a fair price. It allows individuals to offer their possessions for rent and enables others to directly interact with them to rent the desired items. This application provides an opportunity for people to earn money by renting out their valuable goods and allows those who cannot afford to buy expensive items to rent them for a specified period at a fixed fee. QuickRent aims to create a win-win situation for both renters and rentees, catering to the growing market of online rental platforms.

## Problem Analysis
The QuickRent project aims to address several renting difficulties. Often, people need tools or items for a short period but hesitate to purchase them due to the high cost. QuickRent offers a solution by allowing users to rent items on a pay-per-use basis, reducing the financial burden of purchasing infrequently used items. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for individuals to generate extra income by renting out underutilized possessions.
